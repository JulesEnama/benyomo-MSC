          We believe that there is nothing like a river trip for relaxing. That
          is why we subscribe to the dry oar philosophy of boating.
          <br />Keeping your oars dry for us means taking time to look around
          and notice the beauty that surrounds the rivers we love.

        <p class="  home-paragraph-2">
          That doesn't mean we don't also like rapids. Opposites in all things
          after all. We believe that that tenseness that comes when you are
          <br />
          looking down the tongue of a big string of waves makes you appreciate
          the calm beautiful water that always follows even more.
